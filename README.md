The game engine (GEFS) was written by [Dr. Stephen J. Guy](https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~sjguy/), we have made some small modifications to the shader codes.

# Instructions

To build the project, run the following commands in the repository directory:
```shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
cd ..
```

To start the game, run:

cd GEFS
./engine scenes/Chess/
```

*Note: The `/` after `Chess` is important.*
